Given: atmega644

Reqs:
 - ISP programming header - 4pins shared
 - blinky LED for success indicator - 1 pin
 - keep serial pins open for eventual read-to-PC, or write-from-PC - 2 pins
 - 15/16pin address bus - 16 pins
 - 8pin data bus        - 8 pins
 - 3pin control bus (we, re, ce) - 3 pins
=== 4 shared pins + 30 pins
Budget: 32 pins available on atmega644 == clear!

Atmega nub on left (pin1/40 on left edge)

PB0-7 p1-8         -> data bus (with ISP shared header pins)
      PB0 pin 1 is lowest, PB7 in middle is most significant bit
PA0-7 p40-33       -> address high (PA7 highest bit !!)
      A8 is atmega PA0 40 to SRAM 25
      A8 is top left, increasing as it goes right towards middle
PC7-0 p29-22       -> address low (PC0 highest bit !!)
      A0 is atmega PC7 29 to SRAM 10
      A0 in top middle, left of its group, counting up to the right end of chip
PD7 p21 at end     -> indicator LED
PD0 / PD1          -> serial, leave unconnected
PD2 PD3 PD4 16 17 18    -> we, rd, ce

Problem: I/O 7 is mucking around on the eeprom (toggling to show activity or whatever); when
connected to SCLK/PB7, then during a atmega flash there will be pin contention and it buggers
up the flash. Bloody annoying.
---> So moving I/O 7 over to PD5 (previously unused), though this breaks convenience -- can't just
set PB to byte and call it a day .. have to set PB, and then also set bit7 onto PD5. Sucks.
